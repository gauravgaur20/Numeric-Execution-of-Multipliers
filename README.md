#Implementing circuit using verilog

Optimised and configured different types of multipliers by using HDL Verilog
language based on railing software.

• Numerically executed specialized 8-bit multiplier such as Wallace tree multiplier,
array multiplier, and booth multiplier

• Reviewed and implemented the multiplierto get an output

• Technologies used: HDL Verilog
